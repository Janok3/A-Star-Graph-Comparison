# A-Star-Graph-Comparison

## The Goal
Design a number of graphs that are very challenging to A*. You need to run the algorithm on your graphs, give variant graphs (by small changes to your graphs),  and show that your designed graphs are really challenging to the algorithm mentioned above. You need to run the algorithm to demonstrate.
